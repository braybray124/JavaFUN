# JavaFUN
This is like my short adventure into learning java, seeing how it works and eventually posting and publishing my own javascript or java code to github for some use for it. I may sure post like Minecraft mods to here as a test and creating them for i like the game why not make something cool for it like WonderLand.jar or maybe something else.
